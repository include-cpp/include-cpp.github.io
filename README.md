## Help and instructions for maintaining this site

Please see [the pages listed in this site's Wiki](https://github.com/include-cpp/include-cpp.github.io/wiki).

## Actions

### Content

* Review and make consistent the syntax used for internal links:
    * `<a class="page-link" href="/shop/">Shop</a>` vs
    * `[Shop](/shop)` vs
    * `[Shop](/shop/)`
* Under attending-conferences.md, add dinners, panels, sale of books
* Under organising-conferences.md, list what makes a conference inclusive
* On shop page, add some pictures of non-shirt merch and explain what we do with the money
* resources.md: Review content and structure
* Review [Kate's previous suggestions](https://github.com/include-cpp/include-cpp.github.io/issues/10) to make sure we don't forget anything.
* Review page title (Currently "Who are we")
* Add a favicon
  
### Formatting and maintainability

* Fix the position and resizing of the new Sidebar, so it looks good on a wide range of screen widths, and works on phones - see [Issue 14](https://github.com/include-cpp/include-cpp.github.io/issues/14)
* Replace the hard-coded links in [_includes/sidebar.html](https://github.com/include-cpp/include-cpp.github.io/blob/rework_navigation/_includes/sidebar.html) with something data-driven. See [the Jekyll Navigation docs](https://jekyllrb.com/tutorials/navigation/) for examples of how to do this.

### Notes from 2019-12-03 call

* Clare will work on getting the menu working as a parallel thing
* can we get more eyes on the organising-conferences.md page? really long stuff is there commented out right now
* is there a web page or something that will automatically list our mods/admins? like on slack?
* our official name has a space in it. Fix on website and elsewhere whenever we can.
* Reorganize resources page and add subcategories under sidebar - later
