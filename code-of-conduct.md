title: "#include ＜C++＞ Code of Conduct"
---

Introduction
------------

- Diversity and inclusion make our community strong. We encourage participation from the most varied and diverse backgrounds possible and want to be very clear about where we stand.
- Our goal is to maintain a safe, helpful and friendly community for **everyone**.
- This code and related procedures also apply to unacceptable behaviour occurring outside the scope of community activities, in all community venues— online and in-person— as well as in all one-on-one communications, and anywhere such behaviour has the potential to adversely affect the safety or well-being of community members.

Expected Behaviour
-----------------

- Be welcoming.
- Be kind.
- Look out for each other.

Unacceptable Behaviour
---------------------

The following behaviours are unacceptable in all `#include <C++>` Discord channels, and in any physical or online events officially organised by its administrative team:

- Violence, threats of violence or violent language directed against another person.
- Sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist or otherwise discriminatory jokes and language.
- Posting or displaying sexually explicit or violent material.
- Posting or threatening to post other people’s personally identifying information ("doxing").
- Personal insults, particularly those related to gender, sexual orientation, ethnicity, religion, or disability.
- Inappropriate photography or recording.
- Inappropriate physical contact. You should have someone’s consent before touching them.
- Unwelcome sexual attention. This includes sexualised comments or jokes, inappropriate touching, groping, and unwelcomed sexual advances.
- Deliberate intimidation, stalking or following (online or in person).
- Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behaviour.
- Sustained disruption of community events, including talks and presentations.

Enforcement
-----------

- Understand that speech and actions have consequences, and unacceptable behaviour will not be tolerated.
- If an issue occurs, please contact a moderator. On Discord their names are highlighted in blue or red.
- If violations occur, organisers will take any action they deem appropriate for the infraction, up to and including expulsion.
- There are [moderation guidelines]({{site.baseurl}}/moderation).
  - If you believe that an administrator has not followed the moderation guidelines properly, please report this using the same methods as a Code of Conduct violation.
