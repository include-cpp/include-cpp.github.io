## Unconscious and implicit bias

* [Managing unconscious bias -- Facebook](https://managingbias.fb.com/)
  * A series of videos on recognising unconscious biases which you have and suggestions on how to counter them.
  * Split into multiple sections:
    * Series introduction
    * First impressions -- if you aren't sure about watching the series, watch this one; it will get you thinking about your own biases which you may not have thought about before.
    * Stereotypes and performance bias
    * Performance attribution bias
    * Competence/Likeability tradeoff bias
    * Maternal bias
    * Business case for diversity and inclusion
   * The content is very well presented and the videos can be watched independently of one another.
* [eLesson: Unconscious Bias -- Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/diversity/training/default.aspx)
  * More of a corporate approach, which may be boring for some engineers, but there's some good content.
  * This is mostly focused on meetings rather than the many other forms of collaboration which we use.
  * If you are a manager then this is probably a better option than the Facebook one.

## Problematic Words and Phrases

### Metaphors

Some words and phrases in longtime use in software development have associations that are uncomfortable or painful for some people. When the people hurt by a word or phrase are under-represented, such words can become commonly used despite being hurtful. As we learn to be more welcoming and inclusive, that can include adjusting our language to avoid words with historical connotations that cause pain. 

What's more, such uses are almost always metaphors, and not all members of our industry share a given set of cultural references to draw on for such metaphors. Maybe you're familiar with cowboy movies in which the good guys wear white hats and the bad buys wear black hats: someone who grew up on a different continent from you, or 40 years after you, may not be.

<!-- #### Blacklist -->

#### Master

The word master has painful connotations for many people, because of its use in slavery. It is therefor important to avoid using it. Even when the historical use for it is not related to slavery, it's still important to avoid using it, because of the pain it will cause some of your users/readers.

## Illustrations

We communicate not only with words, but with images. If your talk, blog post, article or tweets all feature able-bodied white men, you might not know where to find anything different. Here are some starting points.

## Glossary

Some behaviours are so common in response to diversity efforts that they have been named and categorized. Knowing that a particular line of argument or way of talking to you is common may help you resist it, and deal with it more confidently.
