We have been aware for a few months now of a grave situation regarding the participation of a certain individual in a C++ conference. #include <C++> tried as a group to address said situation and make sure it doesn't go unnoticed nor happens again.

We are aware that one person decided to publish the confidential documents we were working on about this subject, which were not yet approved through consensus as we always do.

The publication of these documents should not be considered as an official position from #include <C++>. We will communicate later on the subject once we are ready and have considered all the implications.
