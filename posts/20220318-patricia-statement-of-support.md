18 March 2022

We would have preferred to publish as a group. We acknowledge that it was too long between
November 2021, when some members learnt how CppCon and the C++ Standard Foundation acted, and March
2022, when this information was published. We are going to internally address the root problems that
led to this slowness. We completely understand how this long time can have been frustrating and
distressing.

People can have imperfect reactions when feeling rightfully angry. Ignoring or attacking such anger
is a toxic reaction that strengthens systemic inequalities. We will not do that and will not let
people use our name and communications to attack Patricia.
