Everyone can help make the C++ community more welcoming and inclusive. May we suggest:

* Read our [resources](/resources/), and [let us know](/#how-can-we-be-contacted) about anything that's worth adding.
* [Join our Discord](/discord/).
* Order stuff from [our shop](/shop/) - and wear it in public!
* Support our [conference scholarships](/conferences/scholarships/).
* Adopt a [code of conduct](/resources/#conferences-and-codes-of-conduct) at things you run.
* Encourage things you don't run (eg conferences that want you to attend or speak) to adopt a [code of conduct](/resources/#conferences-and-codes-of-conduct) and enforce it.
* Let others know about us.
* If you run a community resource or conference, you could add a link to this site, and ask us to add you to the [Community sponsors](/community-sponsors) page.
