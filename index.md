## Who are we?

`#include <C++>` is a global, inclusive, and diverse community for developers interested in C++. Here, you can find a welcoming space to learn and discuss C++. We also provide resources to create safer, more inclusive, community gatherings.

Our goal is a more welcoming and inclusive C++ community, as expressed in conferences, the committee, industry and so on. We work hard both to make these changes, and to support others such as [conference organisers](/conferences/organising-conferences/), who share our goals.

We believe that a community is only as good as how it treats its most vulnerable members. Therefore, we strive to create a welcoming, safe, and accessible environment. We have a strong [Code of Conduct](/code-of-conduct), which we [enforce](/moderation).

Our primary communication platform is our [Discord server](/discord/). Join us to discuss and learn C++ in a welcoming, inclusive space.

The moderation and administration team includes Sy Brand, Noam Chitayat, Kate Gregory, Adi Shavit, and Fred Tingaud.

Everyone who supports our goals, whether a member of any under-represented groups or not, is welcome to participate in any way - see [What can I do?](/what-can-i-do/) Many of our leaders and contributors are allies and we are grateful for all they do. If you want C++ to be more welcoming and inclusive, you'll be welcomed and included.

## What do we do?

We provide:

- A set of [resources](/resources) on diversity and inclusion.
- An inclusive, welcoming space for people to discuss and learn C++.
  - We have a [Discord server: please join](/discord/).
  - We have a [friendly presence at conferences](/conferences/attending-conferences).
- Help for minorities and junior programmers with [scholarships to attend major conferences](/conferences/scholarships). You can apply for scholarships, and donate to them.
- Help for minorities and junior programmers in submitting talks for conferences or job applications.
- A [toolbox](https://github.com/include-cpp/toolboxes/releases/latest) for C++ conferences to improve diversity and inclusion.
- Help for conferences in reaching minority groups with calls for papers, and suggesting candidates to invite to speak and <a class="page-link" href="/conferences/organising-conferences/">running an inclusive conference</a>.
- Help for companies in improving their C++ job advertisements to improve appeal to minority groups.

We are always doing more, and are open to suggestions for new ideas!

We used to support CppCon but we [no longer do](/conferences/attending-conferences#CppCon-Safety).
